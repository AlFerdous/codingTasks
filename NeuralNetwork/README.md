### Logic Gates Truth Table Prediction
This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a neural network that predicts the output of Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOR, NAND, and XOR Gate). By optimizing the neurons, weights, and biases, we demonstrate how neural networks can learn and generalize from input data.

#### Importance:
Understanding neural networks and their components (neurons, weights, and biases) is crucial for anyone interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. These concepts form the foundation of deep learning models and enable us to solve complex problems across various domains.

○ This is a simple example of a Neural Network project that efficiently predicts OR, AND, NOR, NAND & XOR Gate Truth Table.

○ This aspect of coding shows how Neural Networks actually works at its core - throughout its Neuron, Input Layers, Hidden Layers to Output Layers. Learning this code is as important as a Neural Network's Learning Rate as Learning Rate plays a crucial role in training Neural Networks, being a hyperparameter that controls how much the model’s weights are updated during each iteration of training, determining the step size or the rate at which the model adapts to the problem. Likewise, during  the training, the weights are iteratively adjusted to minimize the difference between the network’s predictions and the actual outcomes i.e. weights fine-tune the network’s ability to make accurate predictions. Similarly, while weights determine the strength of connections, Biases provide an additional layer of flexibility to neural networks acting as an activation threshold, ensuring that Neurons activate even with weak input, letting Neurons work together to process information to produce accurate output.
