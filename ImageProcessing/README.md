## Image Processing with RandomForestClassifier

### Description
This project demonstrates the application of a RandomForestClassifier to the task of image processing. Utilising the MNIST dataset, the code employs GridSearch and Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize the model's performance, ensuring high accuracy in Image classification.

### Importance
Learning to implement RandomForestClassifier in image processing is crucial for developing robust machine learning models capable of high-precision predictions. This project showcases how to fine-tune a model to achieve over 98% accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits, making it a valuable learning resource for coding enthusiasts and professionals alike.
