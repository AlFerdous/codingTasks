# Coding Tasks Repository

Welcome to the Coding Tasks repository, where we explore the fascinating world of machine learning with Python. This repository contains two main projects: Neural Network Logic Gate Truth Table Prediction and Image Processing with RandomForestClassifier. Dive into the code and discover how these models are implemented and fine-tuned for high accuracy.

## Projects

### Neural Network: Logic Gate Truth Table Prediction
- **Description**: The Neural Network project focuses on creating a model that accurately predicts logic gate truth tables. It demonstrates the power of neural networks in understanding and replicating the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits.
- **Features**: 
  - Generate truth tables for logic gates
  - Train neural network models for prediction
  - Evaluate model performance with accuracy metrics

### Image Processing: RandomForestClassifier
- **Description**: The Image Processing project showcases the application of a RandomForestClassifier to classify images with high precision. Using the MNIST dataset, this project includes GridSearch and Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize the classifier's performance.
- **Features**: 
  - Process MNIST dataset images
  - Implement RandomForestClassifier for image classification
  - Achieve over 98% accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits
  - Utilize Hyperparameter Tuning for model optimization

## Installation
To set up the environment for these projects, you will need Python 3 and several libraries. Install them using the following command:

    pip install numpy matplotlib sklearn pandas seaborn


## Usage
Each project comes with a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the steps of loading datasets, preprocessing data, training models, and evaluating their performance. Follow the instructions within the notebooks to run the code and see the models in action.
